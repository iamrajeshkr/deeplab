# Chatbot (Live Update Version)

## Overview
This is the updated version of our chatbot, which now writes responses live in real-time instead of processing everything in the backend and displaying the result all at once in the frontend.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Response Streaming**: The chatbot now streams its responses live, improving user experience and reducing perceived response time.
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Users can see messages being typed, making interactions more natural and interactive.
- **Optimized Backend Processing**: Responses are generated and sent incrementally, reducing memory overhead and improving performance.
- **Seamless Frontend Integration**: Works smoothly with frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or plain JavaScript.

## How It Works
1. **User sends a query**: The chatbot receives the input.
2. **Backend processes incrementally**: Instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated, the chatbot streams partial responses.
3. **Live updates in the frontend**: The frontend dynamically displays the chatbot's response as it is being generated.
4. **Final completion message**: Once the response is fully generated, it is marked as complete.

## Technical Implementation
- **WebSockets / Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Enables real-time data transfer from backend to frontend.
- **Streaming APIs**: Utilizes OpenAI / custom LLM models with streaming capabilities.
- **Frontend Integration**: Uses event listeners to append streamed messages dynamically.

## Installation & Setup
### Backend
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai
```
Run the server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Frontend
Ensure your frontend listens for streamed messages:
```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/chat-stream');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Received:', event.data);
    appendToChat(event.data);
};
```

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multi-turn conversations with context persistence.
- Improved typing indicator for better UX.
- Integration with multiple AI models for response variation.
